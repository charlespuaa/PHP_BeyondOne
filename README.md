ETIER Clothing is an educational e-commerce web application designed for our fictional fashion retail brand. This project demonstrates a PHP-based online store system with essential features like user registration (with email confirmation), categorized product listings, cart functionality, and payment flow (mocked). It is developed as a final project for our CCS0043/L course.
